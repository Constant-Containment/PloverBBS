Hello and I suppose Welcome?

We will find out within some minor effort whether this shall actually progress.
So far we have a prototype branching CVS primitive and nothing else.
Main Should remain empty with attachment lineages of two or more.

I'm not sure how to do this yet but it is probably a transparent process to
omit commits to any branch and to automate in one or two directions?
